# Blood-cells-classification
The blood cells dataset made by 管理员小F(https://www.datafountain.cn/datasets/149) which contains data and images of four types of blood cells—Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil—is used as the foundation and several modifications are made with the dataset. 
The CSV labels are introduced. The SVM classifer program that can classify the blood cells types is designed based on the modified database. 
To realize the function, the directroy structure should remain the same. The zip files should be unzipped and put under the current directory that the zip file is at. 
Run main() to form and train the SVC model
